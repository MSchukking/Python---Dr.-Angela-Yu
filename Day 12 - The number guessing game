#Number Guessing Game Objectives:

# Include an ASCII art logo.
# Allow the player to submit a guess for a number between 1 and 100.
# Check user's guess against actual answer. Print "Too high." or "Too low." depending on the user's answer. 
# If they got the answer correct, show the actual answer to the player.
# Track the number of turns remaining.
# If they run out of turns, provide feedback to the player. 
# Include two different difficulty levels (e.g., 10 guesses in easy mode, only 5 guesses in hard mode).

# Starting up: 
clear() 
print(logo)
print("Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!")
print("I\'m thinking of a number between 1 and 100.")
RANDOM_NUMBER = random.randint(1, 100) # Create a random integer between 1 and 100, including 1 and 100 
print(RANDOM_NUMBER)
print(type(RANDOM_NUMBER))

# Defining the level: 
level = input("Choose a difficulty. Type \'easy\' or \'hard\': ")
print(level)
print(type(level))
if level == "easy":
    attempts = 10
elif level == "hard":
    attempts = 5
print(f"You have {attempts} attempts remaining to guess the number")
print(type(attempts))

# Guessing
guess = int(input("Make a guess: "))
print(type(guess))

# TOMORROW Next: Compare the guess with the RANDOM_NUMBER
