import another_module

print(another_module.another_variable)

# Import module named 'turtle'
# import turtle
# Call class inside the turtle and put it in an object names 'timmy'
# A class always starts with capitals and does not use underscores:
# timmy = turtle.Turtle()

# or shorter:
from turtle import Turtle, Screen
timmy = Turtle() # create a new object 'timmy' from blueprint Turtle()
print(timmy)

# Call methods associated with the object: 
timmy.shape("turtle") # change shape of timmy to a turtle
timmy.color("chartreuse2") # change color of timmy
timmy.forward(100) # move timmy forward with 100 steps
# Screen is a class that represents the window in which the turtle is going to show up
# Create object 'my_screen'
my_screen = Screen()  # create from blueprint Screen()
# showing: '300' wich is the height of the canvas of the screen created:

# Tab in attributes associated with the object: 
print(my_screen.canvheight)  # object.attribute

# Object methods:
my_screen.exitonclick()
"""Instead of screen just showing up for a second
will allow our program to continue running, until we click on the screen"""
# Turtle in the form of a arrow in the middle. This is timmy
# Changed timmy into a tuurtle by 'timmy.shape("turtle')
