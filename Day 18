# import turtle
from turtle import Turtle, Screen  # import class Turtle and Screen from module turtle

# create turtle and change it appearance:
tim = Turtle()  # create object from class Turtle
tim.shape("turtle")  # change timmy's shape into a turtle
tim.color("lime green")  # change timmy's color to green

# make the turtle do certain things:
# timmy_the_turtle.forward(100) # make the turtle move forward 100 paces
# timmy_the_turtle.rt(90)  # turn south

# to keep the screen, and only let it disappear when we click on the screen:
# this part of code needs to stay at the bottom of the code:
# it needs to happen after we done all the stuff with turtle
screen = Screen()
screen.exitonclick() # create attribute exit_on_click in object screen
