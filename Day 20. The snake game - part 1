# we mar 9 and we mar 10, 2022
# day 20 - the snake game - part 1
# OBJECTIVE: Create the Nokia snake game

from turtle import Screen, Turtle
from snake import Snake
import time  # this time module will help to slow down what is happening

# create screen and adjust its appearance:
screen = Screen()
screen.setup(width=600, height=600)  # set the screens sizes
screen.bgcolor("black")  # set the screens background color
screen.title("Snake Game")  # set the title at the top of the screen
# make the snake move smoothly as one piece:
screen.tracer(0)  # turns tracer off -> now screen.update() can be used to tell the program when to refresh the screen
# without screen.update() we will only see a black screen

snake = Snake()

# ToDo 3: CONTROL THE SNAKE
screen.listen()  # start listening for keystrokes
screen.onkey(key="Up", fun=snake.up)
screen.onkey(key="Down", fun=snake.down)
screen.onkey(key="Left", fun=snake.left)
screen.onkey(key="Right", fun=snake.right)

# ToDo 2: MOVE THE SNAKE
game_is_on = True
while game_is_on:
    screen.update()  # refresh the screen
    time.sleep(0.1)  # delay for 0.1 second

    snake.move()

# Day 21 - the snake game - part 2
# ToDo 4: DETECT COLLISION WITH FOOD
# Put food on the screen and detect collision of the food
# ToDo 5: CREATE SCOREBOARD
# Learn to write text in our program. Once the snake hits the food, the score updates
# ToDo 6: DETECT COLLISION WITH WALL
# Show game over on screen + Snake stops moving
# ToDo 7: DETECT COLLISION WITH TAIL
# When the head collides with the body of the snake it is Game Over

screen.exitonclick()  # screen only disappears when you click
