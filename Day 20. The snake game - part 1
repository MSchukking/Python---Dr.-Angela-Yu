# OBJECTIVE: Create the Nokia snake game

# create screen and adjust its appearance:
screen = Screen()
screen.setup(width=600, height=600)  # set the screens sizes
screen.bgcolor("black")  # set the screens background color
screen.title("Snake Game")  # set the title at the top of the screen
# make the snake move smoothly as one piece:
screen.tracer(0)  # turns tracer off -> now screen.update() can be used to tell the program when to refresh the screen
# without screen.update() we will only see a black screen

# ToDo 3: CONTROL THE SNAKE

# Day 21 - the snake game - part 2
# ToDo 4: DETECT COLLISION WITH FOOD
# Put food on the screen and detect collision of the food
# ToDo 5: CREATE SCOREBOARD
# Learn to write text in our program. Once the snake hits the food, the score updates
# ToDo 6: DETECT COLLISION WITH WALL
# Show game over on screen + Snake stops moving
# ToDo 7: DETECT COLLISION WITH TAIL
# When the head collides with the body of the snake it is Game Over
