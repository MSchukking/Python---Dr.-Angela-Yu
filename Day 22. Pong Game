# day 22. build pong: the famous arcade game
# OBJECTIVE: build the ping pong game

# this code consists of: main.py, paddle.py, ball.py and score.py


# main.py: 

from turtle import Screen
from paddle import Paddle

# todo 1: create the screen and adjust its appearance:
screen = Screen()
screen.setup(width=800, height=600)  # change screen size
screen.bgcolor("black")  # set screen background to black
screen.title("Pong Game")  # set the title at the top of the screen

# make the game move smoothly:
screen.tracer(0)  # turns tracer off --> now screen.update() can be used to tell the program to refresh the screen
# without screen.update() we will only see a black screen because it is never updated

# todo 2a: create a paddle:
l_paddle = Paddle(start_x=-350, start_y=30)

# todo 3: create another paddle
r_paddle = Paddle(start_x=350, start_y=30)

# todo 4: create a ball and move it constantly across the screen
ball = Ball()

# todo 7: score: detect when paddle misses
# todo 8: keep score
scoreboard = Scoreboard()

# todo 2b: move the paddle:
screen.listen()  # start listening for keystrokes
screen.onkey(key="w", fun=l_paddle.up)
screen.onkey(key="s", fun=l_paddle.down)

    # measures distance from ball center to paddle center which is probably > 15. instead you need to measure it like
    # this:
    if ball.distance(l_paddle) < 50 and ball.xcor() < -335 or ball.distance(r_paddle) < 50 and ball.xcor() > 335:
        """ball bounce from the paddle in its opposite direction"""
