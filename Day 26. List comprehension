# list comprehension exercises:

# D26.235:
# INSTRUCTIONS: You are going to write a List Comprehension to create a new list called squared_numbers. This new list
# should contain every number in the list numbers but each number should be squared.

numbers = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]
# ðŸš¨ Do Not Change the code above ðŸ‘†

#Write your 1 line code ðŸ‘‡ below:
squared_numbers = [n**2 for n in numbers]


#Write your code ðŸ‘† above:

print(squared_numbers)


# d26.236
# INSTRUCTIONS: You are going to write a List Comprehension to create a new list called result. This new list should
# only contain the even numbers from the list numbers. DO NOT modify the List numbers directly. Try to use List
# Comprehension instead of a Loop.

numbers = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]
# ðŸš¨ Do Not Change the code above

#Write your 1 line code ðŸ‘‡ below:
result = [n for n in numbers if n % 2 == 0]

#Write your code ðŸ‘† above:

print(result)


#d26.237
# INSTRUCTIONS: Take a look inside file1.txt and file2.txt. They each contain a bunch of numbers, each number on a new
# line. You are going to create a list called result which contains the numbers that are common in both files.

# file1.txt:

# main.py:

file1 = open("file1.txt", mode = "r").readlines()  # opens each line as a string item in a list
# remove \n at the end of each item
