# # list comprehension exercises:
#
# # D26.235:
# # INSTRUCTIONS: You are going to write a List Comprehension to create a new list called squared_numbers. This new list
# # should contain every number in the list numbers but each number should be squared.
#
# numbers = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]
# # ðŸš¨ Do Not Change the code above ðŸ‘†
#
# #Write your 1 line code ðŸ‘‡ below:
# squared_numbers = [n**2 for n in numbers]
#
#
# #Write your code ðŸ‘† above:
#
# print(squared_numbers)
#
#
# # d26.236
# # INSTRUCTIONS: You are going to write a List Comprehension to create a new list called result. This new list should
# # only contain the even numbers from the list numbers. DO NOT modify the List numbers directly. Try to use List
# # Comprehension instead of a Loop.
#
# numbers = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]
# # ðŸš¨ Do Not Change the code above
#
# #Write your 1 line code ðŸ‘‡ below:
# result = [n for n in numbers if n % 2 == 0]
#
# #Write your code ðŸ‘† above:
#
# print(result)
#
#
# #d26.237
# # INSTRUCTIONS: Take a look inside file1.txt and file2.txt. They each contain a bunch of numbers, each number on a new
# # line. You are going to create a list called result which contains the numbers that are common in both files.

# d26.239. learning about dictionary comprehension
# for a list of names. Create a dictionary with a random score for each name:
# import random
# names = ["Alex", "Beth", "Caroline", "Dave", "Eleanor", "Freddie"]
#
# student_scores = {
#     student: random.randint(1, 100) for student in names
# }
#
# # all students with a score higher than 60 passed, all others failed their year:
# passed_students = {
#     name: score for (name, score) in student_scores.items() if score >= 60
# }
#
#
# # d26.240. exercise - dictionary comprehension
# # INSTRUCTIONS: You are going to use Dictionary Comprehension to create a dictionary called result that takes each
# # word in the given sentence and calculates the number of letters in each word.
# # Try Googling to find out how to convert a sentence into a list of words.
# # Do NOT Create a dictionary directly. Try to use Dictionary Comprehension instead of a Loop.
#
# sentence = "What is the Airspeed Velocity of an Unladen Swallow?"
# # Don't change code above ðŸ‘†
#
# # Write your code below:
# sentence_list = sentence.split()  # makes a string into a list of words/strings
#
# result = {
#     word: len(word) for word in sentence_list
# }
#
# print(result)


# d26.241
# INSTRUCTIONS: You are going to use Dictionary Comprehension to create a dictionary called weather_f that takes each
# temperature in degrees Celsius and converts it into degrees Fahrenheit.
# To convert temp_c into temp_f: (temp_c * 9/5) + 32 = temp_f
# Do NOT Create a dictionary directly. Try to use Dictionary Comprehension instead of a Loop.

weather_c = {
    "Monday": 12,
    "Tuesday": 14,
    "Wednesday": 15,
    "Thursday": 14,
    "Friday": 21,
    "Saturday": 22,
    "Sunday": 24,
}
# ðŸš¨ Don't change code above ðŸ‘†
weather_f = {
    day: (temp*9/5)+32 for (day, temp) in weather_c.items()
}

# Write your code ðŸ‘‡ below:
print(weather_f)
