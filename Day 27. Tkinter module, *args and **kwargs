# OBJECTIVES: learn about the tkinter module, *args and **kwargs 

# main.py: 

import tkinter

FONT = ("Arial", 24, "bold")  # a tuple

window = tkinter.Tk()
window.title("My first GUI Program")  # title at the top of the window
window.minsize(width=500, height=300)  # the window will change with the amount of buttons in the window

# Label - How to create a label
my_label = tkinter.Label(text="I am a label", font=FONT)  # this by itself won't show a label in the screen. Needs .pack() for this
my_label.pack(side="left")  # packs the label on the screen and puts it in the center of the window
# https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html#the-packer

window.mainloop()  # keeps window on screen and listens to what user wants to do. This line of code always needs to
# be at the end of the code


# playground.py: 

def add(*args):
    sum = 0
    for n in args:
        sum += n
    return print(sum)

add(3, 3, 3, 3)

def calculate(**kwargs):
    print(kwargs)

calculate(add=3, multiply=5)


# make a calculator:
def calculate(n, **kwargs):
    print(kwargs)
    n += kwargs["add"]
    n *= kwargs["multiply"]
    print(n)

calculate(2, add=3, multiply=5)


# the Tkinter module works with **kw because it was created from another language than Python
# below here explains how the Tkinter module was created:
class Car:

    def __init__(self, **kw):
        self.make = kw["make"]
        self.model = kw["model"]
        self.color = kw.get("color")  # .get() is same method as the one above, but will give NONE instead of an error
        # when the key is not in the dictionary "kw"
        self.seats = kw.get("seats")

my_car = Car(make="Nissan", model="GT-R")
print(my_car.make)
