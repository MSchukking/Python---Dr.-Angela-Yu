# Day 3. Exercise 5. Love calculator.
# To work out the love score between two people:
# Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs. 
# Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs. 
# Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number.

print("Welcome to the Love Calculator!")
name1 = input("What is your name? \n")
name2 = input("What is their name? \n")

# Combine names and put in lower case:

name = name1 + name2
name_lower_case = name.lower()

# Count letters: 

count_true = str( name_lower_case.count("t") + name_lower_case.count("r") + name_lower_case.count("u") + name_lower_case.count("e") )
count_love = str( name_lower_case.count("l") + name_lower_case.count("o") + name_lower_case.count("v") + name_lower_case.count("e") )
love = int(count_true + count_love)

# Output of the scores: 

if ( love <= 10 ) or ( love >= 90 ):
    print(f"Your score is {love}, you go together like coke and mentos.")
elif ( love >= 40 ) and ( love <= 50 ):
    print(f"Your score is {love}, you are alright together.")
else:
    print(f"Your score is {love}.")
