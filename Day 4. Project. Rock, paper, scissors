#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
# 1. What is my input?

# 2. Put rock paper scissors in a list:
result = [rock, paper, scissors]

# 3. Generate random result by the computer? 
import random
computer = result[random.randint(1, 3) -1 ]
print(computer)

# 4. Who won, who lose?

  elif computer == scissors:
    print("One hit with the rock, destroys the scissors.\nYou win!")
