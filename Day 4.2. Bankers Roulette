# Day 4.2. (D4.44): Bankers Roulette
# After food and drinks in a restaurant, who is going to pay the bill?

# Input who is at the table?: 
names_string = input("Give me everybody's names, separated by a comma. ")

# .split(", ") -> Takes out ", " and put the separate items in a list 
names = names_string.split(", ")

# Number of items (as integer) in the list "names"
length = len(names) 

# Generate random number (integer) from number of items in the list:
import random
random = random.randint(0, length - 1)

# Name of the random number in the list:
paying = names[random]

# Print who is paying: 
print(f"{paying} is going to buy the meal today!")

# NOTE: A faster/easier way to do this is by using:
# paying = random.choice(names)
