# We Feb 2, 2022
# Day 5.1. (D5.51) Exercise: 

# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code below ğŸ‘‡
student_heights = input("Input a list of student heights ").split()
for n in range(0, len(student_heights)):
  student_heights[n] = int(student_heights[n])
# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code above ğŸ‘†

#Write your code below this row ğŸ‘‡

# NOTE: Not allowed to use the len() and sum() function for this exercise. 
# 1. Use for loop to add all the items together
# 2. Use for loop to figure out how many items there are in the list
# 3. Calculate the average height 
# Use round(): rounds the average height before you print it (see day 2.24)

# Make variables that are integers:
sum_heights = 0
number_students = 0

# Mimic the sum function (in sum_heights) and len function (in number_students):
for height in student_heights:
  sum_heights += height
  number_students += 1
  
# Print and calculate the average height:
print(round(sum_heights / number_students))
