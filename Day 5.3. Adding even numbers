# Day 5.(D5.54) Exercise 5.3. Adding even numbers 

# Write a code to calculate the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 100. 
# Thus, the first even number would be 2 and the last one is 100: 

# Create a integer variable
even = 0

# Write for loop that adds all even numbers from 2 to 100: 
for number in range(0, 101, 2):
  even += number
  
# Print the result: 
print(even)
