# Day 5.(D5.55) Exercise 5.4. FizzBuzz 

# Write a program that automatically prints the solution of the FizzBuzz game.
# The FizzBuzz game:
# Print each number from 1 to 100 in turn, however:  
# When the number is divisible by 3 instead print "Fizz"
# When the number is divisible by 5 instead print "Buzz"
# When the number is divisible by 3 and 5 instead print "FizzBuzz"

#Write your code below this row ðŸ‘‡

for number in range(1, 101):
  if number % 3 == 0 and number % 5 != 0:
    print("Fizz")
  elif number % 3 != 0  and number % 5 == 0:
    print("Buzz")
  elif number % 3 == 0 and number % 5 == 0:
    print("FizzBuzz")
  else:
    print(number)
