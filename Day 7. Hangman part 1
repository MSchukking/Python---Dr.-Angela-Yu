word_list = ["aardvark", "baboon", "camel"]

#TODO-1 - Randomly choose a word from the word_list and assign it to a variable called chosen_word.
# Chose a random integer between 0 and 2
import random     # Import random module
chosen_word = random.choice(word_list) # Gives a random word of the word_list

# type(chosen_word) = string

#TODO-2 - Ask the user to guess a letter and assign their answer to a variable called guess. Make guess lowercase.
guess_letter = input("What letter are you guessing?\n").lower() # type(guess_letter) = string
