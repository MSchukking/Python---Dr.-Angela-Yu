# Day 8 (D8.83) Exercise 8.1. Paint Area Calculator 

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
import math
def paint_calc(height, width, cover):
    number_of_cans = (height * width) / cover
    print(f"You\'ll need {math.ceil(number_of_cans)} cans of paint.") # math.ceil() round up

#Write your code above this line ðŸ‘†
# Define a function called paint_calc() so that the code below works.   

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
test_h = int(input("Height of wall: "))
test_w = int(input("Width of wall: "))
coverage = 5
paint_calc(height=test_h, width=test_w, cover=coverage)
