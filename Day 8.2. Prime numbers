def prime_checker(number): 
    
    prime = True
    for x in range(2, number): # Includes 2, but not number 
        if number % x == 0:
            prime = False

    if prime:  # Same as if prime == True: 
        print("It\'s a prime number.")
    else: 
        print("It\'s not a prime number.")
